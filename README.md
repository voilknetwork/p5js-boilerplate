# P5JS BoilerPlate Code

Creating a new P5 JS project and adding the JS files, linking them again and again can be tough.
Instead just clone this repository :)

```
git clone https://github.com/voilknetwork/p5js-boilerplate
cd p5js-boilerplate

// open with code
code .
```

and start creating your P5JS project :)
I also added matter.js in this repo.
