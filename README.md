# Creating a new project, and adding the JS files, linking them again and again for every new project?

Don't do it :) just clone this repo

`
git clone https://github.com/voilknetwork/p5js-boilerplate
cd p5js-boilerplate

// open with code
code .
`

and start creating your P5JS project :)
I also added matter.js in this repo.
